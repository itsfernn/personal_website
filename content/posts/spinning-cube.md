## Introduction

Programming is all about problem-solving, and sometimes the best way to improve is by **challenging yourself**. In my latest side project, I set out to write a **3D spinning cube** entirely in **C**—without looking anything up. No tutorials, no external help—just raw problem-solving and deep diving into **low-level programming**.

This project, hosted on **GitHub** ([itsferguson/spinning-cube](https://github.com/itsferguson/spinning-cube)), was an opportunity to practice my **C skills**, experiment with **complex linear algebra**, and implement **convex hull algorithms** in a self-contained, pure C environment.

## The Motivation

I wanted to push myself to:

- **Improve my C programming skills** without relying on external references.
- **Figure things out independently**, mimicking real-world problem-solving scenarios.
- **Work with mathematical concepts**, like **3D transformations**, **matrix operations**, and **convex hull computation**.
- **Develop a simple graphics project** purely with low-level code, no libraries.

This was less about the end result and more about the **process of learning**—debugging, optimizing, and understanding how things work under the hood.

## What’s Inside the Repo?

This project is a small yet challenging exercise in **computer graphics and computational geometry**. Here’s what I implemented:

### 🔷 **3D Rendering from Scratch**
- A **spinning cube** rendered using fundamental **3D transformations**.
- Manual **matrix multiplication** for rotating objects in 3D space.
- Projection from **3D to 2D** without relying on graphics libraries.

### 🔢 **Complex Linear Algebra**
- Custom **vector and matrix operations** implemented without external math libraries.
- Understanding transformations, rotations, and perspective projection through manual calculations.

### 🔺 **Convex Hull Algorithm**
- Implemented to solve computational geometry problems.
- Used in rendering and mesh generation.
- Helps in understanding **geometric algorithms** and how they apply to 3D graphics.

## Lessons Learned

- **Writing code without looking things up is HARD.** But it’s an amazing way to really internalize concepts.
- **C forces you to think deeply about memory, efficiency, and structure.** It’s easy to take higher-level abstractions for granted.
- **Linear algebra is everywhere in computer graphics.** Understanding rotations, transformations, and projections gave me a deeper appreciation for how graphics engines work.
- **Debugging without easy references builds real problem-solving skills.** I had to rely purely on logic, debugging tools, and patience.
